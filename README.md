<h1> Bare Logic </h1>
<h3> Think Fast. Learn Smart. Stay Wild.</h3>



Why BareLogic? Why reivent a minimal version of useful AI tools? Well, lets ask 
[Richard Hipp](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/)
the author SQLite, 
who is famous for (re)building the tools he  uses day to day.

 >  People go backpacking,
 long hikes, where they carry
 everything they need on their back and they talk about how freeing
 that is because they are taking care of themselves.

>  ... (Packbacking)  **involves doing without**. ....
Whenever a politician comes to you and says, “Oh, we’re
going to take care of this problem for you.” What they’re really
saying is, we’re going to take away some of your freedoms. The
exercise for you, here, is to figure out what freedoms they’re going
to take away in order to solve this problem, and they’re often
well-disguised, but yeah, if you want to be free, that means doing
things yourself.

Too long-winded for you? Well how about:

― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Airman's Odyssey

In his book [Empirical Methods for AI](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/spring08/reading6/CohenTutorial.pdf), 
William Cohen argues that
supposedly sophisticated methods should be benchmarked
against seemingly stupider ones (the so-called “straw man”
approach). I can attest that when ever I checked a supposedly sophisticated method against
a simpler one, there was always something useful in the
simpler. And more often than not, a year later, I have
switched to the simpler approach.

Repeat that for 30 years of programming, and you get BareLogic.
