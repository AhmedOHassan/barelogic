Why BareLogic? Why reivent a minimal version of useful AI tools?

Well, lets ask 
[Richard Hipp](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/)
the author SQLite, 
who is famous for (re)building the tools he  uses day to day.

 >  People go backpacking,
 long hikes, where they carry
 everything they need on their back and they talk about how freeing
 that is because they are taking care of themselves.

> You’re not dependent on different vendors providing you something. Suppose I had elected to go with Berkeley DB as the storage engine for SQLite version two.
Well, at that time Berkeley DB was open source, but then later it was sold off to Oracle, and it became a duel source proprietary model and you can’t get hold of the source code to the later versions without paying license fees, yada, yada, yada, so, suddenly it becomes a problem.


>  ... (Packbacking)  **involves doing without**. ....
Whenever a politician comes to you and says, “Oh, we’re
going to take care of this problem for you.” What they’re really
saying is, we’re going to take away some of your freedoms. The
exercise for you, here, is to figure out what freedoms they’re going
to take away in order to solve this problem, and they’re often
well-disguised, but yeah, if you want to be free, that means doing
things yourself.

Too long-winded for you? Well how about:

>  Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. <br>
― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Airman's Odyssey

In his book [Empirical Methods for AI](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/spring08/reading6/CohenTutorial.pdf), 
William Cohen argues that
supposedly sophisticated methods should be benchmarked
against seemingly stupider ones (the so-called “straw man”
approach). I can attest that when ever I checked a supposedly sophisticated method against
a simpler one, there was always something useful in the
simpler. More often than not, a year later, I have
switched to the simpler approach.

And if you repeat that "switch to the simpler"  stuff for 40 years of AI programming, you get BareLogic.
